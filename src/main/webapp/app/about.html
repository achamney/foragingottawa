        Primarily, the goal of Foraging Ottawa is to bring folks together with a common interest. "Together" could mean discussions occurring in the forums, 
        it could mean sharing forage sightings and locations, or it could mean everyone getting together to go mushroom hunting.
        <br />

        Here is our vision of what we think the website will be used for: 
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Sharing your experience.</li>
                    <li>Journaling</li>
                    <li>Reflection</li>
                    <li>Teach others</li>
                <li>That there is an abundance of edible goods waiting to be harvested in Ottawa.</li>
                <li>There is an army of like-minded individuals in Ottawa who are equally excited about this abundance.</li>
                <li>We could all use a bit of help learning about the environment, and what it can provide for us.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>We are eccentric locals who love everything that Ottawa has to offer. As a GIS developer and a GIS analyst, respectively, we love
        anything spatial in nature. And what is more spatial than harvesting locations within Ottawa!</p> 
        
        <p>We hope to use this website to share our adventure in learning more about nature and our surroundings. We are by no means
        experts and hope to benefit from other users' experiences.</p>

        <p>This site was inspired by fallingfruit.org and its amazing ideas, albeit the lack of any community, or Canadian presence.</p>
